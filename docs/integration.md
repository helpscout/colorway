# Integrating with Colorway

Once we've created our unique [manifest](./manifests.md) for our Application, we can work on integration!

## Installing

Within your application, add Colorway as a devDependency in your `package.json`. You can do this by running the command:

```
npm install @helpscout/colorway --save-dev
```

## Creating scripts

In your `package.json`, add a dedicated npm script to run Colorway. It my look something like this:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "colorway": "colorway --manifest=hsds-react",
    ...
  }
}
```

In the above example, we've created a `colorway` npm script. This can be executed by running this command:

```
npm run colorway
```

The `--manifest=hsds-react` tells Colorway to use the `hsds-react` [manifest](./manifests.md) to generate the file.

## Building with Colorway

Add the new `colorway` script to run before your build scripts. It is recommended that you also do this for your `start` or `development`/`dev` scripts.

```
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "colorway": "colorway --manifest=hsds-react",
    "prebuild": "npm run colorway",
    "build": "...",
    "prestart": "npm run colorway",
    "start": "...",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Using the Colorway generated files

It is up to your Application to import and use the contents generated by Colorway. Typically, this is only required to be set up once. After the initial set up, the process of updating and maintaining the color values should automatically come from the build scripts.

## Next

Next, let's look into how we can handle [updating](./updating.md) with Colorway.
