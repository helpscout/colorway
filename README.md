## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev @helpscout/colorway
```

## Usage

Run the `colorway` command with the manifest you wish to sync, example:

```
colorway --manifest=hsds-react
```

For a more automated/magical feed, we recommend you add this as a `prestart` or `prebuild` command in your `package.json`:

```
{
  ...
  "colorway": "colorway --manifest=hsds-react",
  "prestart": "colorway",
  ...
}
```

## find & Closest

Run the `colorway` command with `find` or `closest` as argument to:

### Find

Find will retrieve the HEX color code for a given color name. It will only use the HSDS-react manifest

```
colorway find blue.500

// blue.500: #1292EE
```

### Closest

Closest will find the color name from our palette that is the nearest from a given HEX code. It will only use the HSDS-react manifest

```
colorway closest #005500

// green.900: #23633e
```
